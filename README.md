Ubuntu Laptop
======

Laptop is a script to set up an ubuntu laptop for web development.

It can be run multiple times on the same machine safely.
It installs, upgrades, or skips packages
based on what is already installed on the machine.

Requirements
------------

We support:

* Ubuntu 16.04 (64 bit)
* Ubuntu 16.10 (64 bit)

Other versions may work but are not tested, pull requests/bug reports welcome.

Install
-------

Download, review, then execute the script:

```sh
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dropsofserenity/ubuntu-laptop/master/ubuntu
sh mac 2>&1 | tee ~/laptop.log
```
Debugging
---------

Your last Laptop run will be saved to `~/laptop.log`.
Read through it to see if you can debug the issue yourself.
If not, copy the lines where the script failed into a
[new GitHub Issue](https://github.com/dropsofserenity/ubuntu-laptop/issues/new) for us.
Or, attach the whole log file as an attachment.
